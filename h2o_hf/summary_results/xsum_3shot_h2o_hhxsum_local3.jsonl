Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\". \"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said. \"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. \"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\" Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. \"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\" \"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\" Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. \"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. \"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said. \"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. \"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\" A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "There is a \"chronic\" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "There are not enough homes available for ex-offenders in Wales, according to a charity.

The four have been charged with hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping and battery, among other things. An online fundraiser for their victim has collected $51,000 (\u00c2\u00a342,500) so far. Denying the four suspects bail, Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil asked: \"Where was your sense of decency?\" Prosecutors told the court the beating started in a van and continued at a house, where the suspects allegedly forced the 18-year-old white victim, who suffers from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, to drink toilet water and kiss the floor. Police allege the van was earlier stolen by Mr Hill, who is also accused of demanding $300 from the victim's mother while they held him captive, according to the Chicago Tribune. The court was also told the suspects stuffed a sock into his mouth, taped his mouth shut and bound his hands with a belt. In a video made for Facebook Live which was watched millions of times, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. The victim had been dropped off at a McDonalds to meet Mr Hill - who was one of his friends - on 31 December. He was found by a police officer on Tuesday, 3 January, a day after he was reported missing by his parents. Prosecutors say the suspects each face two hate crimes counts, one because of the victim's race and the other because of his disabilities.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Four people accused of kidnapping and torturing a mentally disabled man in a \"racially motivated\" attack streamed on Facebook have been denied bail.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "Four people have been charged with hate crimes after a mentally disabled man was allegedly tortured and beaten.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["F", "our", "\u2581people", "\u2581have", "\u2581been", "\u2581charged", "\u2581with", "\u2581hate", "\u2581cr", "imes", "\u2581after", "\u2581a", "\u2581ment", "ally", "\u2581disabled", "\u2581man", "\u2581was", "\u2581alleg", "edly", "\u2581tort", "ured", "\u2581and", "\u2581be", "aten", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "\u2581A", "\u2581man", "\u2581has", "\u2581been", "\u2581charged", "\u2581with", "\u2581murder", "\u2581after", "\u2581a", "\u2581", "3", "2", "-", "year", "-", "old", "\u2581woman", "\u2581was", "\u2581found", "\u2581dead", "\u2581in", "\u2581a", "\u2581house", "\u2581in", "\u2581the", "\u2581north", "\u2581of", "\u2581England", ".", "\u2581The", "\u2581woman"], "token_logprobs": [-0.11594457179307938, 0.0, -0.07466422021389008, -0.0029488196596503258, -0.0031506207305938005, -2.2172682292875834e-05, -0.006061030086129904, -0.5249254703521729, -0.004668526817113161, 0.0, -0.10477352142333984, -0.007670827675610781, -0.5260380506515503, 0.0, -0.22237516939640045, -0.21431168913841248, -8.34461570775602e-06, -0.523685097694397, 0.0, -0.3861083686351776, 0.0, -0.2176080048084259, -0.18620425462722778, 0.0, -0.4918803870677948, -0.013580316677689552, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -5.769562994828448e-05, -7.510157047363464e-06, -1.1920928244535389e-07, -0.0002165798214264214, 0.0, 0.0, -0.45952296257019043, -0.6895055174827576, -0.22916841506958008, -0.0015354283386841416, -0.22970841825008392, -0.0028498058672994375, -0.18186640739440918, -0.07476599514484406, -0.0073510161601006985, -0.25636887550354004, -0.695671558380127, -1.4831019639968872, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.15859393775463104, -0.019048618152737617, -0.050511155277490616, -0.0015448314370587468, -0.10658343881368637, -0.010369354858994484, -0.2162550389766693, -0.0023093954659998417, -0.6650087237358093, -1.1490206718444824, -0.44063058495521545, -0.00782223790884018, -5.054346183896996e-05, -0.19782359898090363, -0.07347221672534943], "top_logprobs": [{"F": -0.11594457179307938, "our": 0.0, "\u2581people": -0.07466422021389008, "\u2581have": -0.0029488196596503258, "\u2581been": -0.0015354283386841416, "\u2581charged": -0.22970841825008392, "\u2581with": -0.0028498058672994375, "\u2581hate": -0.5249254703521729, "\u2581cr": -0.004668526817113161, "imes": 0.0, "\u2581after": -0.07476599514484406, "\u2581a": -0.010369354858994484, "\u2581ment": -0.5260380506515503, "ally": 0.0, "\u2581disabled": -0.22237516939640045, "\u2581man": -0.6895055174827576, "\u2581was": -0.019048618152737617, "\u2581alleg": -0.523685097694397, "edly": 0.0, "\u2581tort": -0.3861083686351776, "ured": 0.0, "\u2581and": -0.2176080048084259, "\u2581be": -0.18620425462722778, "aten": 0.0, ".": -5.054346183896996e-05, "<0x0A>": -1.1920928244535389e-07, "##": -5.769562994828448e-05, "#": -7.510157047363464e-06, "Art": -0.0002165798214264214, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "\u2581A": -0.45952296257019043, "\u2581has": -0.22916841506958008, "\u2581murder": -0.18186640739440918, "\u2581": -0.25636887550354004, "3": -0.695671558380127, "2": -1.4831019639968872, "-": 0.0, "year": 0.0, "old": 0.0, "\u2581woman": -0.07347221672534943, "\u2581found": -0.050511155277490616, "\u2581dead": -0.0015448314370587468, "\u2581in": -0.0023093954659998417, "\u2581house": -0.2162550389766693, "\u2581the": -0.6650087237358093, "\u2581north": -1.1490206718444824, "\u2581of": -0.44063058495521545, "\u2581England": -0.00782223790884018, "\u2581The": -0.19782359898090363}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. \"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\" BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs). \"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. \"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\" His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\" Peter Bowes: Fasting for science Peter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why. However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet. He told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\" He said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance. Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes. \"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\" Follow James on Twitter.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "The pancreas can be triggered to regenerate itself through a type of fasting diet, say US researchers.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "A diet that mimics fasting could reverse diabetes, animal experiments suggest.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["A", "\u2581di", "et", "\u2581that", "\u2581m", "im", "ics", "\u2581fast", "ing", "\u2581could", "\u2581reverse", "\u2581di", "ab", "etes", ",", "\u2581animal", "\u2581experiments", "\u2581suggest", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "\u2581The", "\u2581UK", "'", "s", "\u2581biggest", "\u2581super", "market", "\u2581chain", "\u2581has", "\u2581said", "\u2581it", "\u2581will", "\u2581stop", "\u2581s", "elling", "\u2581eggs", "\u2581from", "\u2581c", "aged", "\u2581h", "ens", "\u2581by", "\u2581the", "\u2581end", "\u2581of", "\u2581", "2", "0", "2", "5", ".", "\u2581The", "\u2581move", "\u2581by", "\u2581T", "es", "co"], "token_logprobs": [-0.03889508917927742, -0.008010641671717167, 0.0, -0.027674999088048935, -0.010818048380315304, 0.0, 0.0, -0.27640217542648315, 0.0, -0.2249445617198944, -0.5837038159370422, -0.8315590620040894, 0.0, 0.0, -0.47136572003364563, -0.8834271430969238, -0.0713864415884018, -0.0012942517641931772, -6.318072337307967e-06, -0.002852183301001787, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.00029416524921543896, -8.34461570775602e-06, -5.125986263010418e-06, -0.0006822404102422297, 0.0, 0.0, -0.6496480703353882, -0.7636926770210266, -0.044396303594112396, 0.0, -0.7869912385940552, -0.766483724117279, -0.024473220109939575, -0.08169274032115936, -0.0833878442645073, -0.33319661021232605, -0.0007391819381155074, -0.04831691458821297, -0.2352980673313141, -0.004462047480046749, 0.0, -0.5828068256378174, -0.0009267802815884352, -0.0008493629866279662, -3.576278118089249e-07, -0.0022966694086790085, 0.0, -0.03969842940568924, -0.485992968082428, -4.768370445162873e-07, 0.0, -0.00041762212640605867, 0.0, 0.0, -0.00029595286468975246, -0.15448053181171417, -0.0005683475756086409, -0.4236988425254822, -0.06944223493337631, -0.46359628438949585, -0.009717659093439579, 0.0, 0.0], "top_logprobs": [{"A": -0.03889508917927742, "\u2581di": -0.8315590620040894, "et": 0.0, "\u2581that": -0.027674999088048935, "\u2581m": -0.010818048380315304, "im": 0.0, "ics": 0.0, "\u2581fast": -0.27640217542648315, "ing": 0.0, "\u2581could": -0.2249445617198944, "\u2581reverse": -0.5837038159370422, "ab": 0.0, "etes": 0.0, ",": -0.47136572003364563, "\u2581animal": -0.8834271430969238, "\u2581experiments": -0.0713864415884018, "\u2581suggest": -0.0012942517641931772, ".": -0.0005683475756086409, "<0x0A>": -5.125986263010418e-06, "##": -0.00029416524921543896, "#": -8.34461570775602e-06, "Art": -0.0006822404102422297, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "\u2581The": -0.4236988425254822, "\u2581UK": -0.7636926770210266, "'": -0.044396303594112396, "s": 0.0, "\u2581biggest": -0.7869912385940552, "\u2581super": -0.766483724117279, "market": -0.024473220109939575, "\u2581chain": -0.08169274032115936, "\u2581has": -0.0833878442645073, "\u2581said": -0.33319661021232605, "\u2581it": -0.0007391819381155074, "\u2581will": -0.04831691458821297, "\u2581stop": -0.2352980673313141, "\u2581s": -0.004462047480046749, "elling": 0.0, "\u2581eggs": -0.5828068256378174, "\u2581from": -0.0009267802815884352, "\u2581c": -0.0008493629866279662, "aged": -3.576278118089249e-07, "\u2581h": -0.0022966694086790085, "ens": 0.0, "\u2581by": -0.46359628438949585, "\u2581the": -0.485992968082428, "\u2581end": -4.768370445162873e-07, "\u2581of": 0.0, "\u2581": -0.00041762212640605867, "2": -0.00029595286468975246, "0": 0.0, "5": -0.15448053181171417, "\u2581move": -0.06944223493337631, "\u2581T": -0.009717659093439579, "es": 0.0, "co": 0.0}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. \"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. \"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. \"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. \"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. \"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. \"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said. \"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. \"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says. \"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.

She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme. Houvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures. The report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment. British Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview. Both Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling. Houvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture. A government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently. It is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies. Houvenaghel claimed: British Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\". It said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\". The statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\" Who else has spoken out? Houvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011. She retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury. Houvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time. Speaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission. At the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\". He added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\" British Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\". Other elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling. Asked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race. \"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities. \"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative. \"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\" Houvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age. \"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012. \"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them. \"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\" Fourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying. Asked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals. \"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through. \"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "A \"medal at any cost\" approach created a \"culture of fear\" at British Cycling, says former rider Wendy Houvenaghel.", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "British Cycling has \"no excuse\" for bullying and ageism, says Olympic silver medallist Katie Archibald.\n\n", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["B", "rit", "ish", "\u2581Cy", "cling", "\u2581has", "\u2581\"", "no", "\u2581exc", "use", "\"", "\u2581for", "\u2581bul", "lying", "\u2581and", "\u2581age", "ism", ",", "\u2581says", "\u2581Olympic", "\u2581silver", "\u2581med", "all", "ist", "\u2581K", "atie", "\u2581Arch", "ib", "ald", ".", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "##", "#", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "\u2581A", "\u2581man", "\u2581has", "\u2581been", "\u2581ja", "iled", "\u2581for", "\u2581", "1", "8", "\u2581months", "\u2581after", "\u2581he", "\u2581admitted", "\u2581to", "\u2581the", "\u2581m", "ans", "la", "ugh", "ter", "\u2581of", "\u2581a", "\u2581", "1", "6"], "token_logprobs": [-0.30325400829315186, -2.5748875486897305e-05, -0.005179676692932844, -1.6212332411669195e-05, 0.0, -0.07885207235813141, -0.7525755167007446, -0.8193930387496948, -2.1576648578047752e-05, -0.05009171739220619, -1.168244216387393e-05, -5.960462772236497e-07, -0.79219651222229, 0.0, -0.3128680884838104, -0.30000826716423035, -6.460934673668817e-05, -0.02541990764439106, -0.050272777676582336, -0.8828195333480835, -0.0277194082736969, -6.890059739816934e-05, 0.0, 0.0, -0.4957556128501892, 0.0, -0.042830437421798706, -3.3378546504536644e-06, 0.0, -0.002552824327722192, -1.0371154530730564e-05, 0.0, -0.0002108589978888631, -6.198863957251888e-06, -8.940656698541716e-06, -0.004792156629264355, 0.0, 0.0, -0.2577970027923584, -0.6120967268943787, -0.29436230659484863, -0.0019055319717153907, -0.44378313422203064, 0.0, -0.0029246911872178316, -0.052623797208070755, -0.010028453543782234, -0.9846868515014648, -0.15718312561511993, -0.42871105670928955, -0.38887855410575867, -0.10443960130214691, -0.2206747829914093, -1.0765571594238281, -0.07781019806861877, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.05299299582839012, -0.5384449362754822, -0.4852970242500305, -1.270660400390625], "top_logprobs": [{"B": -0.30325400829315186, "rit": -2.5748875486897305e-05, "ish": -0.005179676692932844, "\u2581Cy": -1.6212332411669195e-05, "cling": 0.0, "\u2581has": -0.29436230659484863, "\u2581\"": -0.7525755167007446, "no": -0.8193930387496948, "\u2581exc": -2.1576648578047752e-05, "use": -0.05009171739220619, "\"": -1.168244216387393e-05, "\u2581for": -0.0029246911872178316, "\u2581bul": -0.79219651222229, "lying": 0.0, "\u2581and": -0.3128680884838104, "\u2581age": -0.30000826716423035, "ism": -6.460934673668817e-05, ",": -0.02541990764439106, "\u2581says": -0.050272777676582336, "\u2581Olympic": -0.8828195333480835, "\u2581silver": -0.0277194082736969, "\u2581med": -6.890059739816934e-05, "all": 0.0, "ist": 0.0, "\u2581K": -0.4957556128501892, "atie": 0.0, "\u2581Arch": -0.042830437421798706, "ib": -3.3378546504536644e-06, "ald": 0.0, ".": -0.002552824327722192, "<0x0A>": -8.940656698541716e-06, "##": -0.0002108589978888631, "#": -6.198863957251888e-06, "Art": -0.004792156629264355, "icle": 0.0, ":": 0.0, "\u2581A": -0.2577970027923584, "\u2581man": -0.6120967268943787, "\u2581been": -0.0019055319717153907, "\u2581ja": -0.44378313422203064, "iled": 0.0, "\u2581": -0.5384449362754822, "1": -0.4852970242500305, "8": -0.9846868515014648, "\u2581months": -0.15718312561511993, "\u2581after": -0.42871105670928955, "\u2581he": -0.38887855410575867, "\u2581admitted": -0.10443960130214691, "\u2581to": -0.2206747829914093, "\u2581the": -1.0765571594238281, "\u2581m": -0.07781019806861877, "ans": 0.0, "la": 0.0, "ugh": 0.0, "ter": 0.0, "\u2581of": 0.0, "\u2581a": -0.05299299582839012, "6": -1.270660400390625}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Mr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient. \"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\" Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US. An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020. \"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr. \"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\" While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age. \"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says. \"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\" Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news. \"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\" But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person. \"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield. \"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge. \"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics. The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\" Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year. Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons. He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring. And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income. Mr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at. \"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500. \"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\" Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks. \"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh? \"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\" While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost. \"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says. \"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it. \"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\" But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh. Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. He says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'. \"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet. \"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt": "Have you heard the one about the computer programmer who bought a failing comedy club in Texas and turned it into a million dollar a year business?", "logprobs": 1, "max_tokens": 64, "n": 1, "stop": ["###"], "temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 1}, "result": {"choices": [{"text": "Article:\n\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticle\nArticle of the\nArt, Edinburgh Waverage attendances\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticle:\nArticl", "logprobs": {"tokens": ["Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", "\u2581of", "\u2581the", "<0x0A>", "Art", ",", "\u2581Edinburgh", "\u2581W", "aver", "age", "\u2581attend", "ances", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle", ":", "<0x0A>", "Art", "icle"], "token_logprobs": [-0.06311028450727463, -0.0002696150622796267, -0.11502406746149063, -0.230571910738945, -0.23748710751533508, -0.006546361371874809, -0.0002002515539061278, -0.003452770644798875, -0.054844390600919724, -0.001708358759060502, -8.940656698541716e-06, -0.001648973091505468, -0.01115596853196621, -0.002442117314785719, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.01669940911233425, -0.010411118157207966, -0.0008525789016857743, -1.0728830375228426e-06, -0.24015192687511444, -0.014853950589895248, -0.0022080582566559315, -0.025439897552132607, -0.083065465092659, -0.042196933180093765, -6.913899414939806e-05, -0.47349750995635986, -0.07037920504808426, -0.5774955153465271, -0.20312447845935822, -0.5630792379379272, -0.8164241313934326, -0.5798821449279785, -0.29407843947410583, -0.0008538890979252756, -0.7521082162857056, -0.44107189774513245, -0.24841880798339844, -0.16679497063159943, -0.007179177366197109, -0.2004844695329666, -0.006856248714029789, -0.03518752008676529, -0.00020859450160060078, -0.491573691368103, -0.0006272017490118742, -0.003944831434637308, -0.0001225396408699453, -0.09486230462789536, -0.0006727101281285286, -0.019154110923409462, -0.000188332938705571, -0.010460784658789635, -0.0031512149143964052, -0.04726364463567734, -0.0007058274932205677, -0.00021741411183029413, -0.007004704792052507, -0.013094622641801834, -0.006708836182951927, -7.092700980138034e-05, -0.003408101387321949, -0.0015511397505179048, -0.00020716428116429597], "top_logprobs": [{"Art": -0.0015511397505179048, "icle": -0.00020716428116429597, ":": -7.092700980138034e-05, "<0x0A>": -0.003408101387321949, "\u2581of": -0.47349750995635986, "\u2581the": -0.07037920504808426, ",": -0.5630792379379272, "\u2581Edinburgh": -0.8164241313934326, "\u2581W": -0.5798821449279785, "aver": -0.29407843947410583, "age": -0.0008538890979252756, "\u2581attend": -0.7521082162857056, "ances": -0.44107189774513245}], "text_offset": []}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "request_time": {"batch_time": 0, "batch_size": 1}}}

Forecasters had predicted a solar storm and good conditions for Aurora Borealis, and sightings of green, pink, purple, red and yellow lights were reported for several hours from about 20:00 GMT. Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria.

BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons. She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were \"practical obstacles\" to a break-up that would delay the process several years. It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap. Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off. Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won. Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband. BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners. This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king. It also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.

Organisers said almost 890,000 people visited the Edinburgh's Christmas events in 2014/15, contributing \u00a3199.5m to the local economy. The three-day Hogmanay celebrations attracted more than 150,000 people, creating an economic impact of \u00a341.8m. Charlie Wood, Edinburgh's Christmas festival director, said: \"This is great news for Edinburgh. The revenue generated does not go to the events themselves, the event organisers or to Edinburgh city council. \"This is money, which is going to the businesses of Edinburgh, be it retail, accommodation, food, drink, shopping and entertainment.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nEdinburgh's winter festivals generated more than \u00a3241m for the city, according to organisers.\n\n###\nArticle: The 25-year-old, from North Ormesby, was shaping metal when a part from the press fell on his foot on 17 March. Teesside Magistrates' Court heard that SM Thompson Limited, of Middlesbrough, had allowed dangerous lifting practices to go unchecked over 10 years. The firm admitted a Health and Safety Executive (HSE) breach and was fined \u00c2\u00a37,500. It must also pay \u00c2\u00a31,120 costs. The hearing heard how the worker had to have the big toe on his left foot amputated and two other toes removed. He was in hospital for seven days but has since returned to work, the hearing heard. HSE inspector Paul Wilson said: \"This worker's injuries need not have happened. \"The failure of SM Thompson to look properly at the risks involved and then organise the lifting operation properly put staff at needless risk. \"This sadly led to the painful and life-changing injuries suffered by this young man.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nA Teesside steel firm has been fined after a worker was crushed by a press and had to have three toes amputated.\n\n###\nArticle: The colourful phenomenon was visible in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but was also spotted as far south as Anglesey in Wales and Staffordshire in England. Aurora Borealis occurs when electrically-charged particles from the sun enter the earth's atmosphere. Many people took to social media to share photographs of the dramatic show. Forecasters had predicted a solar storm and good conditions for Aurora Borealis, and sightings of green, pink, purple, red and yellow lights were reported for several hours from about 20:00 GMT. Gavin Chambers, an RSPB warden, tweeted pictures of vivid green in the sky over Lake Vyrnwy in Powys, Wales, saying: \"Well worth getting back out of bed for!!\" Donna Butcher tweeted: \"Just been watching an amazing display of Aurora from Staveley, Cumbria. Shafts of light streaming directly towards Polaris.\" You can email your pictures and video to yourpics@bbc.co.uk, and find out more about the Northern Lights here.\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\nThere have been spectacular displays of the Aurora Borealis - better known as the Northern Lights - across parts of the UK overnight.\n\n###\nArticle: \"I'm really looking forward to it - the home of Scottish football,\" said Rodgers ahead of his maiden visit. \"I hear the pitch is good, a nice big pitch suits the speed in our team and our intensity. \"The technical area goes right out to the end of the pitch, but you might need a taxi to get back to your staff.\" This will be Rodgers' second taste of the Old Firm derby and his experience of the fixture got off to a great start with a 5-1 league victory at Celtic Park last month. \"It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect,\" he recalled. \"Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but we'll be looking to have a similar performance. \"We'll be prepared and focused. We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time.\" Rodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat. \"The last experience there wasn't so good for Celtic,\" he said. \"But it's a different team with a different mentality and we'll look to take that mentality into the game.\" Rodgers lost two semi-finals in his time at Liverpool and is aiming to make it third time lucky at the club he joined in the summer. \"You have to perform - that's what's important and if you get little bit of luck along the way then hopefully you'll get the result that you want.\" said the Northern Irishman. \"So, for us, it's really looking at our performance level, which in the main has been at a really high level. \"My focus is always on my own team and, if we impose our style of play, it can give a lot of problems to opponents.\" Unlike predecessor Ronny Deila, Rodgers would not be drawn on this semi-final being a step on the way to a potential domestic treble. \"It's very, very difficult to achieve,\" he said. \"There's been great managers here in the past that haven't achieved that. \"But it's the first competition where we've a chance to win a trophy and I've always said that it's a priority for us because it's the first one. \"Our idea was to qualify for the Champions League, which we did, to make a good start in the league, which we've done, and then look to get to the League Cup final. \"Unless you can do that then you don't have the chance to win the trophies.\"\n\nSummarize the above article in 1 sentence.\n", "summary_gt":
